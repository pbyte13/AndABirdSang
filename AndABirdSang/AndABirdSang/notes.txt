***     you could simply delete all songs added more than a month ago to get rid of old ones ...
***     you have to fix the start_time

***     should you have an option where they can just continually update their playlist? perhaps $20/year for constant updating ... ?



***     is it possible to just webscrape twitter search results...

limitations:

*   just going to do the 7-day search to start...
*   

do spotify playlists keep some kind of cache of songs that have been deleted?
eventually we would want to make sure that if a user tried to generate another playlist, but
had deleted songs from a previously created playlist, that those deleted songs would not be added...



You make things work in get_all_songs() by having a limit=100 parameter...potentially after searching ~20 accounts you
could wind up with more than 100 songs and so some will be missed...
